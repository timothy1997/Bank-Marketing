K-Nearest Neighbors Approach for Term Deposit Subscription Classification

This is my approach for the Bank Marketing Data Set, which can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
The goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The data itself is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. I used K-Nearest Neigbors to build this model to practice this specific machine learning model. I will be continuing to update this approach as I learn more.
